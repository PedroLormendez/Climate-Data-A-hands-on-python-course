    "## Computing climatologies and anomalies\n",
    "Climatology,refers to the study and analysis of the climate, typically over extended periods. \"A climatology\" in a data context, usually means a dataset or analysis representing the average or typical state of the climate system over a specified period. This period is often long enough to smooth out year-to-year variations, leaving only the longer-term, more stable patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Climatologies are commonly collected and computed over a 30-year period, as recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). \n",
    "* A climatology often involves computing statistical averages of a climate variable over the chose period.\n",
    "Climatologies are used as a baseline to study current climate conditions, to identify climate anomalies and trends, and in climate modelling and forecasting.\n",
    "* Climatologies are critical in understanding historical climate patterns, which are essential for predicting future climatic changes and for various applications in agriculture, environmental planning, and disaster managment.\n",
